# turing-s-machine-environment
## Description

Turing Machine Visual - software to simulate Turing machine.

This project is in state of active development, I plan to prepare a release by the end of this week.

This application is a part of my course work in the university. 

## Set up

TuringMachine.py is main file, other are modules.

To run the app just open and run TuringMachine.py.

## Requirements

Python 3.4 and above.

## Technical

*.turing is an instance of a Turing's program.

## License

This project is licensed under GNU AGPL License. See LICENSE file for further information.

Found a way to update repo from phone

BETA 6 IS OUT!

# Motivation

## How it is relevant to artificial intelligence

Now my priority is to discover whether or not this project can be related to artificial intelligence.

Example 1: We have some Turing application, where only number of commands is known. And the question is: How many times we need to run the application to recover its code.

Example 2: We have some long-long Turing application. And we have some another small Turing app. The set S -- is a set of input values that both applications produce the same output. And the questions are:
  1. How big could the set S possibly be?
  2. 

Example 3: There is a collection of pairs like (input value, output value), and questions:
  1. Is it possible to develop a Turing application that from each 'input value' produces desired 'output value'?
  2. How small may it be? 
  3*. Can we teach AI to write Turing apps by examining such pairs?
 
Example 4: If we would like to reduce length of some Turing app, how small can we make it?
